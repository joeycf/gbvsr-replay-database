/**
 * Aggregate the parse substrate into the engine's KnownStats shape. Strive's
 * module, unchanged in logic.
 *
 * ── THE STAT UNIT IS SIDE APPEARANCES (checklist step 8) ───────────────────
 * GBVSR is 1v1, so a side fields one character (more only when a player
 * switched mid-set — yumegiwa writes both, `Lanslot Six`) and a mirror match
 * adds TWO to that character's total, which is what the engine's
 * "appearances" labels read as. A per-record deduped union would under-count
 * every mirror. EX mode is a MARK on a base character (types/index.ts), so an
 * EX Narmaya side counts to narmaya — the EX facet filters, it does not split
 * the unit.
 *
 * ONE UNIT, EVERYWHERE: characterUsage, byPatchUsage and playerCharacters share
 * a denominator; emit.ts asserts all three totals. NO pairingUsage — there is no
 * same-side duo on a 1v1 game.
 *
 * The byPatchUsage key order is the meta chart's x-axis, seeded from the patch
 * table (23 builds, oldest → newest) so a patch with no replays keeps its slot.
